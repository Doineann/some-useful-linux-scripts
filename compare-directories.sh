# The script:
#   1. Converts provided folder paths to absolute paths.
#   2. Recursively loops through all files in folder1 and compares them with those in folder2.
#      For each file in folder1, it extracts its relative path and finds the corresponding file in folder2.
#   3. While processing, it prints a progress indicator (overwritten on the same line) to stderr.
#      If a fileâ€™s name is too long, the beginning and the ending of the filename are shown.
#   4. Any missing or differing files are printed as new permanent lines.
#   5. A second pass compares folder2 against folder1 to report files missing in folder1.
